# Discord
use [Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter) to download discord messages

# Ideas
Convert into Anki cards?
Maybe use [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) to scaffold a frontend for uploading and processing different message file types. maybe use [tailwindcss](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss)
